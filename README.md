During this personal project, I learned new languages (Node.js, css), tackled the React library, 
worked to continuously make code cleaner and less dependent, and implented AWS services to host and
(continue to) optimize this blog. 

I will continue to:
	1. Optimize the code, remove dependencies, and create a clean flow. 
	2. Update this blog with new projects and development examples as they come. 


Resources used during this project: Node.js, css, React, Gatsby, Visual Studios, 
AWS Services (S3 bucket, Cloud front), and the online community (Thank you all!)
